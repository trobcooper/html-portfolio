<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm CVS Chaitanya, a passionate and driven Electronics and Communication
  Engineering student at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT).
  Currently in my 3rd year, I enjoy exploring the intersection of hardware and
  software, particularly through hands-on projects involving IoT, embedded
  systems, and AI/ML integration..
</p>

<p>
  I’ve worked on innovative projects like a Smart Health Monitoring System using
  the ESP32, MAX30102, and DHT22 sensors, integrating real-time data with Edge
  Impulse AI models. I’m also actively developing solutions in the field of
  computer vision, including a parking slot detection and tracking model

<p>
  Alongside my core academics, I’ve developed strong interests in Web
  Development, and I'm building my skills in full-stack technologies. I’m a
  curious learner, problem solver, and someone who enjoys turning concepts into
  real-world solutions. My goal is to contribute to impactful tech innovations
  and pursue opportunities in embedded AI, robotics, and product development.
